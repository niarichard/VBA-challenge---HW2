# VBA-Script Location
The VBA script can be found in the following location:
Homework 2 with repository/VBA Challenge/Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm/alphabetical_testing.xlsm
This script triggers a pop-up message box displaying "Quarterly stock data summary has been created!" when executed.

To run the script, open the Excel file in Microsoft Excel, navigate to the Developer tab, and select 'Macros' to execute the 'Sheet5.CalculateQuarterlyStockData' for Multipule Year Stock and select 'macros' for Alphabetical Testing spreadsheet Sheet1.CalculateQuarterlyStockData
I received help from Xpert Learning Assistant and BCS. I needed extra long help because this was rather difficult for me.
